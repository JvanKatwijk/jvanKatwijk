## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jan van Katwijk
In my teener years I built (physical) radios, devices with tubes and
later with transistors (I skipped the period where more complex chips were available).
After retirement I started with programming SDR, my interests are DAB, DRM and amateur radio

Qt-DAB and dab-cmdline deal with - as the name suggests - decoding of DAB signals.
Qt-DAB is typically large and GUI based, dab-cmdline is command line based, just for
selecting a single service on a given channel.
Some more DAB related programs are in other repositories

The second line is for drm (Digital Radio Mondiale) type decoders, the drm+ decoder is combined drm+ and fm, since both are
(supposed to be) transmitted in the FM band (Here we do not receive drm+, so the decoder is tested with a very few recordings)

The drm-receiver tries to decode DRM30  on shortwaves
Both programs take samples from either an SDRplay device, a Hackrf device or a DABstick,
the DRM30 decoder (which I actually use to listen to DRM transmissions) is
 now equipped with a client for a spyserver, a file reader (96000 S.s) and a reader for the audiocard.

The DRM30 decoder It is derived from the sw receiver, that one is more general and has more decoders

Two programs for weak signal detection are Qt-WSPR and Qt-FT8, decoders with a Qt-based front end,
Input devices here are -again - SDRplay devices, Hackrf devices, (limited) DAB sticks and spyServer input.

The repository contains some other programs as well, e.g. an Algol to C translato, some plugins for SDRuno, etc.
